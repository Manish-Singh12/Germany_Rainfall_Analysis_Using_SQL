![Rainfall](https://github.com/Manish-Singh12/Germany_Rainfall_Analysis_Using_SQL/blob/main/rain.jpg "a title")

The project aimed to analyze climate data across German cities to identify trends, anomalies, and key insights related to rainfall, temperature, and humidity from 2015 to 2023.


## Project Goals

Key Analytical Tasks and Insights:
- How has rainfall varied over the years across different cities or regions in Germany?
- Are there any cities with a significant increase in the frequency of heavy rainfall events?
- Which year had the most significant anomalies in temperature and rainfall across cities?
